CSE 310—Applied Programming
W04-Teach: Project Plan

Assigned Group Number:	8
Unique Team Name:	Trailmix


1.	Select the type of project you will be creating.  Place an “X” under the “Selected Column”:

|Project Type|Selected|
|------------|--------|
|Android App using Java or Kotlin|  |	
|Web App using Django and Python| |	
|Game using Python with either Arcade or PyGame	|X (Using the Unreal)|

2.	Describe the education program you will create.  Additionally, describe how the software will target elementary and secondary students (e.g. pre-college students, K-12).

Our program is designed to teach genetics. Using a modified chess program where pieces’ characteristics can be inherited through a kind or “breeding” process, to make different kinds of pieces. We will be teaching about phenotype and genotype, inheritance, and sexual reproduction. It will target elementary and secondary students by teaching these principles through a fun and engaging game. 

3.	Make a list of specific requirements (that is, functionality) that will be implemented in your software (add more rows if needed).  Your project grade will be based on this list of requirements.

| Your Project Requirements                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pieces need to be able to move correctly according to their abilities.                |
| Pieces need to be able to capture other pieces.                                       |
| Player should be able to view the attributes of a given pieces.                       |
| Pieces need to be able to “reproduce sexually”, and genes passed to created pieces. |
| Genes need to be passed to pieces based on gene types and random values               |
| Program needs to run on the Unreal engine                                             |
| Pieces need to have recognizable physical attributes                                  |
| Game has to be playable.                                                              |
| Static game information is stored into a database                                     |
| Static game information is retrieved from a database                                  |

| Stretch Goals                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Design more legitimate breeding system                        |
| - male/female                                                 |
| - auto-generated or pre-fabricated attributes/movement styles |
| Implementing story mode, game marketplace, tournament mode    |
|                                                               |

4.	Provide a high-level schedule for your project, including researching, implementing features, and testing.  Researching includes anything that you do not currently know how to do.  You should add milestones to your schedule for both prototypes and actual project software.  Put dates on your schedule and ensure that it meets the deadlines for the course.

The bolded days are the days that we need to get the milestones done by. Front is the display part of the project, middle is the processing, and end is the storage.

* Week 5 (Feb 1-**6**): 	
   * milestone - get todo list done:
      * Front - Connect Unreal to Github. 
      * Mid- Have basic chess working
      * Back- Decide what information the database will be used for.
      * Technical training- Github, Unreal

* Week 6 (Feb 8-**13**):
   * milestone - get todo list done:
      * front - make some assets
      * middle/back - create basic piece classes (in unreal c++ script)
      * middle - piece combination logic (breeding)

* Week 7 (Feb 15-**20**):
   * piece interaction (implement chess game logic)
   * general gameplay on unreal
   * recognizable attributes

* Week 8 (Feb 22-**27**):
   * game is playable (and ugly :)
   * piece attribute presentation module

* Week 9 (Mar 1-**6)**:
   * general work as needed

* Week 10 (Mar 8-**13**):
   * game is done and playable

* Week 11 (Mar 15-**20**):
   * finalize documentation
   * bug fixes

* Week 12 (Mar 22-**27**):
   * make video
   * stretch challenges



5.	The team leader is responsible for scheduling and conducting all team meetings.  Who will be the team leader for your project?
